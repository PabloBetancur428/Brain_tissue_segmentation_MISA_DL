# Medical Image Segmentation with UNet++: Coronal View Optimization and Multi-View Integration

This repository contains the implementation and analysis of a medical image segmentation pipeline utilizing the UNet++ architecture. The primary focus is on segmenting 3D medical images by training on different slices and exploring multi-view integration for enhanced performance.

#  Medical Image Registration and Analysis Pipeline

In this repository you can also find a folder called "MIRA", which contains a comprehensive pipeline for medical image registration and analysis, focusing on non-rigid transformations, landmark processing, and lung segmentation in CT datasets. The tools and methods provided here are designed to handle complex tasks such as aligning inhale and exhale CT images, transforming anatomical landmarks, and generating masks for organ-specific segmentation.
